Dora The Exploder
=================

Dora is a 11×11 pixel character that I was originally designed it for an imaginary t-shirt for introverts (for me) to wear with the hope that they will appear more friendly even though they don’t have to smile and make small talk when they are with people.

The idea has been around [since 2009](https://taufik-nurrohman.com/2009/dte-dora-the-explorer), and instead of being a t-shirt, this character has become an avatar and logo for a programming website which I have maintained until now.
